## System Health

- Table:
  - The overall system health table is rendered. This can get complicated on the Battery side as each device works on different voltages.
  - As a default the table will look for the range 0 - 3.6V because the majority of devices use that range. Any other rnage that the device use shoudl be scaled on server side.
